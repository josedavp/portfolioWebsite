# portfolioWebsite
Created from Scratch outside of class in Fall 2022, using a Raspberry Pi 4, NGINX, Bootstrap 5, personalized SSL, and CloudFlare, .KEY & .PEM, JavaScript, PHP (soon to be needed), HTML5, CSS, VSCode, LiveServer, and additional software for security reasons. The website portfolio is an ongoing project, and I will continue to update it as I gain more skills and experience.
